The first few steps... They are deceptively easy. Every small step is an achievement. It lures you in.

And then there comes a point where you get stuck. Of course, this is such a simple thing, it should be easy to do.

Except it isn't. It takes you one day and a half to realize your methods were flawed from their very inception.

So you learn, without getting any validation this time, but you learn none-the-less.

This, in a nutshell, is trying to understand modern front-end development (and if you squint a bit, even life).

Anyway, this blog is finally in a state where I can consistently create and display posts now. So, that is my commitment today.

I'll try to post once per week, let's see how it goes.
